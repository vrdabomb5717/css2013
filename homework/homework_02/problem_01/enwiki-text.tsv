8501507	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fadil_Hoxha	Fadil Hoxha. Fadil Hoxha (Serbian: ????? ????, "Fadil Hod?a") (born March 15, 1916 in ?akovica, Kingdom of Serbia, died April 22, 2001 in Pristina, FR Yugoslavia) was an Albanian politician. Early life. As a young man, Hoxha migrated from his home town of ?akovica to attend secondary school in Albania, since secondary education in the Albanian language was unavailable in Yugoslavia. He continued his education in the town of Shkod?r and later in Elbasan. In Albania he joined a communist cell which provided him his first exposure to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism. He returned to Kosovo in 1941, where he worked as a teacher. In the same year he abandoned his post to become one of the founders of the communist partisan movement in Kosovo. Within a short time Hoxha rose in partisan ranks to become commander, leading battalions which had in their ranks Kosovo Albanians and Serbs who fought against Fascism and Nazism and the Italian and later German occupation of Kosovo. Hoxha was instrumental in the Kosovo communist movement's efforts at adopting a resolution at the Bujan Conference of 1943, which expressed the wish of Kosovo for national self-determination and unification with Albania. However, under Serbian pressure, the Yugoslav Communist Party annulled the resolution, which resulted in Hoxha's marginalization in the party after the end of the war in 1945 and Kosovo's reinstitution into Serbia with a limited degree of autonomy. Politics. Hoxha's political influence in the Yugoslav Communist Party and grew during the 1960s, especially after the removal from the upper echelons of the party of Serb hardliner Aleksandar Rankovi? by Josip Broz Tito. As interior minister, Rankovi? had pursued a notorious policy of repression against Albanians, which was later criticized by the party. Hoxha led efforts to advance Kosovo's constitutional status in a series of constitutional reforms that took place in Yugoslavia. The efforts were consecrated by the Yugoslav constitution of 1974, which granted Kosovo an equal republican status in all but name. Hoxha also fought for the expansion of federal aid and development programs in Kosovo, which led to Kosovo's rapid industrialization throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Hoxha also led or otherwise supported political battles for the expansion of cultural and educational institutions in the Albanian language, leading to the establishment of the University of Pristina in 1970 and a Kosovo Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hoxha subscribed to the principles of Yugoslav policy of "brotherhood and unity", believing in the need to achieve national equality between Albanians, Serbs, and other national groups within Kosovo and Yugoslavia. Hoxha held a number of high posts in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. He served as president of the Assembly of the Kosovo Autonomous Province. He also received the title of People's Hero of Yugoslavia. In 1967 he was appointed to the Yugoslav Communist Party Presidium and in 1974 became a member of the Federal Presidency. In 1978-79 he held the rotating post of Vice President of the Federal Presidency, the highest leadership post in Yugoslavia under Tito. In 1981, Hoxha faced harsh criticism from radical Kosovo Albanian nationalist movements because of his opposition to the massive demonstrations that occurred in the spring of that year, which demanded republican status for Kosovo and Kosovo's unification with Albania. Hoxha and the Kosovar provincial leaders also faced criticism by the Yugoslav party leadership for failures in curtailing the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo. After the rise of Slobodan Milo?evi? in Serbia, Hoxha, though retired, became subject to a number of political attacks labelling him a nationalist and supporter of secessionism. Hoxha was expelled from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and in 1991 the Milo?evi? government tried him for treason. Though in old age, Hoxha survived the 1999 Kosovo War and remained in Kosovo until the end of the war in hiding. He died of natural causes in 2001, and was buried with honors in his home town of ?akovica. Hoxha has published his wartime diary "Kur pranvera vonohet" [When Spring is Late] (Prishtina: Rilindja, 1980) and a three-volume collection of speeches and articles in "Jemi n? sht?pin? ton?" [This is our Home] (Prishtina: Rilindja, 1986), both published in Serbo-Croatian and Turkish editions in addition to the original Albanian. In 2010, an autobiography based on interviews with Fadil Hoxha by Veton Surroi and his father Rexhai Surroi was published under the title "Fadil Hoxha n? vet?n e par?" [Fadil Hoxha, in the first person] (Prishtina: Koha, 2010). He was said to have been a distant cousin of Albanian leader Enver Hoxha.

It is located primarily in Republic County, Kansas and partially in Cloud County, Kansas. Driving directions are North and West of Jamestown, Kansas. The area is commonly called "Jamestown Lake" by local residents. The area is popular for both hunting and fishing. The lake and its surrounding areas are maintained by the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks. History. The Jamestown Wildlife Area is a collection of wetlands and uplands that have been under state management since 1932. The two larger marshes were one of the twelve wetlands sold to provide funding for Emporia State Teachers College. Historically, the area was considered a "salty?, shallow, marshy area. In dry seasons salt could be found. A large amount of wildlife would coome to the area in the wet season. The areas marshes attracted Native Americans, early settlers and were important to migrating herds of bison, flocks of waterfowl and other wildlife. Local residents constructed dams on the lower ends of both large marshes in the early 20th century to provide a more reliable water supply for recreation.
8501552	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laron_syndrome	Laron syndrome. Laron syndrome, or Laron-type dwarfism, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an insensitivity to growth hormone (GH), caused by a variant of the growth hormone receptor. It causes short stature and a resistance to diabetes and cancer. Eponym. It is named after Zvi Laron, the Israeli researcher who, with A. Pertzelan and S. Mannheimer, first reported the condition in 1966, based upon observations which began in 1958. Resistance to GH was first reported by Laron in 1966. Since then, severe resistance to GH, characterized by grossly impaired growth despite normal levels of GH in serum, has been termed Laron syndrome. Pathophysiology. Molecular genetic investigations have shown that this disorder is mainly associated with mutations in the gene for the GH receptor. These can result in defective hormone binding to the ectodomain or reduced efficiency of dimerization of the receptor after hormone occupancy. There are exceptionally low levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and its principal carrier protein, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3. A related condition involving postreceptor insensitivity to growth hormone has been associated with STAT5B. Clinical characteristics. The principal feature of Laron syndrome is abnormally short stature (dwarfism). Physical symptoms include: prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge, underdevelopment of mandible, truncal obesity and a very small penis. Seizures are frequently seen secondary to hypoglycemia. Some genetic variations have an impact upon intellectual capacity. The majority of reported cases have been of Arabic or Semitic origin, with numerous patients in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, and remote villages in Ecuador with Sephardic roots. In 2011, it was reported that people with this syndrome in the Ecuadorian villages are resistant to cancer and diabetes and are somewhat protected against aging. This is consistent with findings in mice with a defective growth hormone receptor gene. Treatment. Administration of GH has no effect on IGF-1 production, therefore treatment is mainly by biosynthetic IGF-1. IGF-1 must be taken before puberty to be effective. IPLEX (Mecasermin rinfabate) is composed of recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) and its binding protein IGFBP-3. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 for treatment of primary IGF-1 deficiency or GH gene deletion. Side effects from IPLEX are hypoglycemia. IPLEX's manufacturing company, Insmed, can no longer develop proteins and can no longer manufacture IPLEX as of a statement released in January 2012. Prognosis. People with Laron syndrome have strikingly low rates of cancer and diabetes. Homo floresiensis. Recent publications have proposed that "Homo floresiensis" represented a population with widespread Laron syndrome. This hypothesis has received criticism and is unconfirmed.

8501585	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canmore_Museum_and_Geoscience_Centre	Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre. Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre (CMAGS) is the public name used by the Centennial Museum Society of Canmore. 'Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre' is the name used by the "Centennial Museum Society of Canmore". The Society was incorporated in 1984 under The Societies Act of the Province of Alberta. The society is also a registered charity. Spanning more than a century since the town was first incorporated, and spanning generations, cultures and social classes, the museum had close to 120 years worth of local history to move from the original location to a new purpose built space in the Canmore Civic Centre in June 2004. Affiliations. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada. The Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre is a member of the "Canadian Museums Association", an organization that represents nearly 2000 museums. Each year, more than 55 million visitors attend Canadian museums. In turn, these institutions employ over 10,000 full-time, around 10,000 part-time employees and are supported by more than 40,000 volunteers. In addition, it is a member of the "Alberta Museums Association". Recognition. The Canmore Museum & Geoscience Centre became one of the museums in the province of Alberta to receive the Recognized Museum designation from the Alberta Museums Association. To earn this designation, the museum provided a panel of museum professionals with evidence achieving internationally recognized criteria of a museum. This designation is achieved by participating in the Museum Affirmation Program, a new initiative designed to strengthen the Association?s accountability toward the public funds it distributes through grants and programming to the province?s museums. As a Recognized Museum, the Canmore Museum & Geoscience Centre has met the internationally recognized definition and standards of a museum. This status is good for 5 years (until 2012), at which point the designation will be revisited. Programs. Programming is an important component of the overall mandate of the organization. Each year several events are co-hosted with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA). Events such as the annual "Rock and Fossil Clinic" have become an important part of science outreach activities in the Canmore area. History. The museum started from a school assignment in 1936. Teacher Edna Appleby gave the students an assignment to write a letter to a foreign country requesting a doll in ethnic dress. One of the students, Mavis Mallabone, continued to collect dolls from all over the world. This significant collection was on display at the original museum until the mid-1990s. The museum as steward of the town?s history has a collection of artifacts from early mining history to the 1988 Winter Olympics and beyond. Miner?s Day is an annual event held on the Saturday closest to July 13, the day the last coal mine closed in 1979 after 92 years of continuous operation. There is a parade of the miner?s families along main street followed by a town BBQ organized by Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre. After the mine closed in 1979, some expected that the town would soon follow the likes of nearby Georgetown, Anthracite and Bankhead and become a ghost town or vanish like the work in the coal mine. Instead, within a few years, Canmore was the site of the Nordic Centre for the 1988 Winter Olympics. The resulting development through the 1990s, and beyond have led to a mountain community with year round tourism as a sought after vacation destination and a major real estate market in recreational property. History buffs have no shortage of places to visit in the town of Canmore including the 19th Century North-West Mounted Police Barracks hosted by the Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre. In addition, the miner?s favourite hang-out, the Canmore Hotel, the original Miner?s Union Hall is still a multi-use facility which will be the cornerstone of the new Lamphouse Theatre project. The entrance is built to give the illusion of walking down a shaft of a blackened coal mine. It is not just a museum of coal mining history, but has a mandate to tell the stories of the heritage of the town and the people of the mountains. There are areas of the museum devoted to archaeology in displays related to Negotiating Place, there have been rotating displays of mountain culture which includes the climbing history of the Rocky Mountains from Lawrence Grassi to Sharon Wood. There are displays of rocks and fossils from the rockies, and the Gordon Tebitt reef display makes the comparison of the Grassi Lakes Devonian reef with a reef system which could be found in the Caribbean tropics today. This museum is also for kids. A big screen TV in the corner allows kids and adults to learn about the geology of the rockies on short DVD programs. Many youngsters also run for the modern computers which have geology games installed. Besides that, there are summer programs for the kids, and there is the annual rock and fossil road show put on with the cooperation and support of organizations like APEGA and the Burgess Shale Foundation. In cooperation with Burgess Shale Foundations, CMAGS has run yearly trips to the Mount Stephen trilobite beds and to the Walcott Quarry. Tours have also been hosted to the Columbia Icefield Visitors' Centre and to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. The museum has also produced multi-media shows which study the changes in the community over time. Interviews were grouped into three main aspects: blessings, challenges and history were among the wide range of ideas and issues considered when looking at the positives and negatives of a growing community. In 2008, the Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre organized a traveling exhibition in celebration of the David Thompson Bicentennials (2007?2011). The exhibit is designed to create not only an awareness of how Thompson?s efforts gave shape and definition to the northwest half of North America. The environment and aboriginal world inhabited by Thompson is also explored in the exhibition. The exhibit called ?David Thompson: 200 Years Later? will travel to other museums and historic sites beginning in 2009. Publications. The first publication by the Canmore Museum & Geoscience Centre is ?Survival in Paradise: A Century of Coal Mining in the Bow Valley?. The book was written by Walter J. Riva, former mine engineer and manager at the Canmore Mines Ltd. and member of the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame; with editing and layout design by Rob Alexander. This important book tells the story of coal mining in the Bow Valley, including Anthracite, Bankhead, Georgetown and Canmore. Events. The Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre hosts many presentations and evening talks showcasing local authors, history, heritage, geoscience and other areas of interest. The museum society has fought to save heritage sites in the Canmore area such as the Canmore Hotel. The museum welcomes feedback regarding the town?s definition of heritage and history.

Dr. Hans-Wilhelm M?ller-Wohlfahrt (born 12 August 1942 in Leerhafe, today part of Wittmund, East Frisia) is the club doctor at Bayern Munich and is a world leader in the treatment of sports injuries. Many of the German doctor's treatments are controversial, including using injections of a substance called Hyalart, extracted from the crest of cockerels, which is claimed to help lubricate knee injuries and take away the pain. He has also injected honey or calves' blood into patients. M?ller-Wohlfahrt's use of homeopathic medicine to treat players is also controversial. Players treated. He has treated many footballers including J?rgen Klinsmann, Ronaldo and Jonathan Woodgate and other sportsmen and women such as Paula Radcliffe Kelly Holmes, Maurice Greene and Usain Bolt. He helped cure Michael Owen's hamstring problems in time to play at the Euro 2000 tournament and has also helped Owen's Liverpool F.C. and England colleague, Steven Gerrard and Harry Kewell. Darren Gough and Alex Tudor, Essex cricketers, have benefited from the German doctor's pioneering treatments. On 6 May 2009 it was announced that he was helping Akpo Sodje recover from a longstanding hamstring problem. He also treated Ronnie Irani, which led to him coining the phrase I I A C. Jos? Mar?a Olaz?bal, the 1994 US Masters golf champion was suffering from the crippling effects of rheumatoid arthritis when he visited M?ller-Wohlfahrt but was able to win at Augusta again in 1999. Rugby World Cup winner Will Greenwood is another who has benefited from the doctor's treatment after 8 months with a groin problem. Weeks later he was staking a claim to a recall to the England team. Even international sportsmen as far away as Australia have sought treatment from M?ller-Wohlfahrt - Australian rules footballers Max Rooke and Mark Coughlan were treated for chronic hamstring injuries. Likewise he has also treated professional cyclists including Stephen Roche. One of his more unusual treatments was when St Johnstone F.C. striker Peter MacDonald was prescribed goat's blood injections in a bid to cure a recurring hamstring problem. In 2010 he treated Bono (singer for U2) and Usain Bolt for severe back injury. In 2012 he was given the job of repairing the hamstring of Dylan Grimes of the AFL club the Richmond Tigers In 2013 he treated knee-injuries of Giorgio Chiellini and Simone Pepe both players of Italian club Juventus FC

8501624	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calusari	The Calusari. "The Calusari" is the twenty-first episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series "The X-Files". It originally aired on the Fox network on April 14, 1995. It was written by Sara B. Charno and directed by Michael Vejar. "The Calusari" is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology, or fictional history. It earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.3, being watched by 7.9 million households in its initial broadcast. Due to perceived inconsistencies in the plot, "The Calusari" received mixed reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a photograph taken just before the death of a two-year-old boy yields evidence of some supernatural intervention which piques Mulder and Scully's curiosity. When another death in the family occurs, the grandmother of the remaining child requests the aid of some Romanian ritualists, named the Calusari, in order to cleanse the home of evil. The script for "The Calusari" was inspired by Charno's experience as a doctor of Eastern medicine. The inspiration for the entry came from an idea series creator Chris Carter had involving someone getting hanged with a garage-door opener. Because "The Calusari" was heavy in terms of violence, Fox's standards and practices department took issues with several scenes. In addition, Carter re-cut the episode after it was completed in order to make it more scary. Plot. In Murray, Virginia, the Holvey family visits a local amusement park. When the youngest child, Teddy, lets his balloon fly away, his father, Steve, gives him a balloon belonging to his older brother, Charlie (Joel Palmer). When the boys' mother, Maggie (Helene Clarkson), is in the bathroom, the strap in Teddy's stroller comes undone. Teddy follows a balloon ? floating under its own power ? out of the restroom and onto the tracks of the park's tour train, leading to his death. Charlie is the only member of the Holvey family not to grieve Teddy's death at the scene. Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken moments before Teddy's death, showing balloon moved horizontally, against the wind. He introduces Scully to a digital photo expert named Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), who uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances in the shape of a child, holding the balloon. The agents visit the Holveys, who dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie?s hand. Steve explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie; strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be harming Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker, Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). While preparing to visit the social worker with Charlie, Steve is strangled when his tie is caught in the seemingly-malfunctioning garage door. Investigating Steve's death, the police find evidence of the ritualistic sacrifices in Golda's room. Mulder finds a film of fine dust in the garage, which Chuck identifies it as vibhuti, a residual sign of spiritual energy. Golda and three elderly C?lu?ari ? Romanian mystics ? conduct a ritual in her room. Meanwhile, during Charlie's appointment with Kosseff, the child goes into convulsions. Kosseff and Maggie see smoke coming from under Golda's door, coming across their ritual. Maggie is horrified, and forces the old men to leave the house. However, Golda grabs Charlie and pulls him into her room in an attempt to complete the ritual. However, Charlie quickly gains the upper hand and brings a pair of dead chickens back to life, ordering them to kill her. When Kosseff asks Charlie about the incident, he insists that he was not in his grandmother's room, and declares that it was a boy named Michael. Maggie is terrified at the claim, explaining to the agents that Michael was Charlie?s stillborn twin. Golda told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael, pretending to be Charlie, convinces Maggie to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, and checks on Charlie. They find the nurse and Charlie still in the hospital room. Mulder, now convinced that some kind of spirit is behind the killings, sends Scully to the Holvey home to stop whatever is about to happen. Maggie tries to conduct the same ritual that Golda had been performing. However, Michael walks in, intent on stopping her. Back at the hospital, Mulder welcomes the Calusari, who begin an exorcism ritual on Charlie. As Mulder helps with the ritual, Scully arrives at the Holvey house, and finds Maggie being attacked by Michael. Scully is tossed across the room by an unseen force. Just as Michael is about to stab Scully, the exorcism ends, and Michael's spirit disappears. Production. The episode was written by Sara Charno and directed by Mike Vejar. Before becoming a writer, Charno had been a doctor of Eastern medicine. According to writer Frank Spotnitz, her "esoteric knowledge that none of the rest of [the writers] had about all kinds of things" was put to use in the script for "The Calusari". The episode was based largely on an idea that series creator Chris Carter had; his thought revolved around a "garage-door opener hanging". When Charlie stands over his grandmother and begins speaking in Romanian, he utters the words "You are too late to stop us." Christine Willes, who plays the part of Agent Kosseff, reprises her role; she originally appeared in the earlier episode "Irresistible". During production of the episode, the producers "agonized" over the teaser?due to the fact that it featured the death of a small child?as well as the darkness of the entire episode. Fox's standards and practices department took issues with Steve's strangulation scene; in the end, the sequence was left in the episode, but Steve's face was obscured to "soften the impact". Although the episode's filming went along smoothly, the final cut "didn't pass muster". Spotnitz explained that Carter "spent a lot of time in the editing room trying to figure out how to make this more terrifying." Spotnitz later noted that Carter's dedication impacted his work ethic and proved that something could be so "much better [?] if you didn't give up." Broadcast and reception. "The Calusari" originally aired on the Fox network on April?14,?1995, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on February 6, 1996. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.3 with an 16 share, meaning that roughly 8.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16?percent of households watching TV, were tuned in to the episode. A total of 7.9?million households watched this episode during its original airing. "The Calusari" is the only episode of the series to have received an explicit rating of "18" in the United Kingdom by the BBFC for "occasional strong horror" and themes involving "demonic possession". "The Calusari" received mixed reviews, with critics citing inconsistencies in the plot as the main detractors. "Entertainment Weekly" gave the episode a "B?" rating, calling it "an "Exorcist"/"Omen" rip-off, but a classy one". Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" gave it a "C+", writing that it was "an episode with a lot of great and spooky moments", but "a messy, chaotic story that could have been much better developed, and too many things that happen [...] just because the writers thought it would be cool if they happened". However, while he was "not sure everything hangs together" and he wished for more backstory, VanDerWerff did praise some "really great moments", particularly the opening teaser. John Keegan from Critical Myth, while calling the episode "a mixed bag", awarded it a 7 out of 10. He praised then entry's "fascinating implications [about] the mythology hidden within the events depicted", and noted that it was "well directed and acted". Despite this, he was more critical of the episode's plot and wrote that there were "clear logical flaws [...] and the subject matter can be disturbing. This is an episode that falls heavily to subjective interpretation." Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", gave the episode a largely negative review and rated it one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two called it a "pale retread of "The Exorcist" and noted that many of the episode's elements, like the chicken-sacrificing grandmother and the Calusari members, were "tremendously crass". Shearman and Pearson, however, did enjoy the episode's dialogue, praising one scene in particular where the sprit of Michael torments his mother by asking to be taken to the amusement park and ride the train that killed his younger brother. Regardless, however, the duo concluded that "there something stale and pointless at [the episode's] heart."

8501682	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership_in_Tasmania	Domestic partnership in Tasmania. Tasmania's "Relationships Act 2003" provided for registration and recognition of a type of registered partnership in two distinct categories: "Significant Relationships" and "Caring Relationships". The same Act also amended 73 pieces of legislation to provide registered partners with nearly all of the rights offered to married couples within the state. Furthermore, since July 2009, these relationships are recognised at federal level, providing couples with almost all of the federal rights and benefits of marriage. The legislation came into effect on 1 January 2004. In September 2010, the Parliament of Tasmania approved legislation to recognize same-sex unions performed outside Tasmania as significant relationships. Significant relationships. Both same-sex and opposite-sex couples can register a "Significant Relationship" if both are unrelated, unmarried adults living in Tasmania. Caring relationships. Likewise, two adults residing in Tasmania, related or not, can register a "Caring Relationship" if one provides the other with domestic support and personal care. The parties cannot be married to each other, cannot be in an existing significant or caring relationship, and neither can be receiving payment for the care of the other either from employment or government departments. Adoption, surrogacy and parenting rights. Same-sex couples cannot be assessed to be adoptive parents of children relinquished by other people (the full joint adoption process) the only law that discriminates against same sex couples in Tasmania. However, they may adopt their partner's child or children they already care for in some circumstances. Under the "Status of Children Act 1974" (section 10C) same-sex partners of women who give birth to children conceived through sperm donation, IVF or other artificial reproductive technology will be presumed to be the child's other parent or co-mother in the same way as male partners of heterosexual women since 1.1.2004 (when the "Relationships Act 2003" commenced). Lesbian co-mothers who went under IVF can have both female names on the birth cirtificate so they can access the same rights and duties for their children (such as medical or hospital forms, education processes, access to entitlements, etc.). The legislation on parentage from IVF is retrospective (meaning the laws apply for co-mothers even before the law went into effect) as currently in the rest of Australia at a state, territory and federal level. Also under the "Adoption Act 1988" (section 29) for a birth-mother's same-sex partner to adopt any children she has through fertility treatment under the stepchild adoption provision. In 2012, Tasmania passed two pieces of legislation to legally allow altruistic surrogacy. The two laws are called the "Surrogacy Act No 34" and the "Surrogacy (Consequential Amendments) Act No 31" Proposed altruistic surrogacy legislation was drafted and passed by both houses of the Tasmanian parliament - only after a review of the "Surrogacy Contracts Act 1993 No 4" and after an ongoing community consultation process. Under the altruistic surrogacy legislation, the surrogate must be at least 25 years old and it cannot be her first pregnancy. The new altruistic surrogacy laws are due to come into effect on January 1, 2013. Recognition from other jurisdictions of Australia. The Australian Commonwealth Government also recognises a Tasmanian registered partnership as a "de facto relationship" under federal law. "De facto" couples, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, are entitled to nearly all of the federal rights of marriage since 1 July 2009. In September 2010, the Tasmanian parliament passed legislation to recognize out-of-state same-sex unions as a significant relationships. Registration. Applications for Significant or Caring Relationships can be registered in person or by mail by filing an application for a Deed of Relationship with the Tasmanian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages in Hobart. Government plan for legalizing same-sex marriage. In August 2012 Tasmanian premier Lara Giddings announced that Tasmania would pass new laws allowing same-sex couples to marry. However, although the same-sex marriage bill passed 13-11 in the lower house, the Legislative Council rejected the bill 6-8 on September 27, 2012.

8501783	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Vance	Donald Vance. Donald Vance (born c. 1976) is an American Navy veteran who was held in detention at Camp Cropper, the United States military's maximum-security detention site in Baghdad for 97 days beginning in April 2006. On December 18, 2006, Vance filed suit against the US government and the former US Secretary of Defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, on grounds that he was tortured and his rights of habeas corpus were violated. He won the 2007 Ron Ridenhour Truth-Telling Prize for coming forward with his story on April 4, 2007. Background. Vance was a 29-year-old Navy veteran from Chicago when he went to Iraq as a security contractor. Vance became an unpaid informant for the F.B.I., passing them evidence that seemed to suggest that the Iraqi security firm at which he worked might be engaged in illegal weapons trading, particularly to officials from the Iraqi Interior Ministry. However, when American soldiers raided the firm, he was treated as a suspect. Another American who worked for the company but had resigned over the alleged weapons trading, Nathan Ertel, was also detained. Vance was held for three months at Camp Cropper, America?s maximum security prison site in Baghdad. Incarceration. Vance claims he was subject to interrogations, inhumane treatment and sleep deprivation techniques during his time at Camp Cropper. A Pentagon spokesperson, First Lt. Lea Ann Fracasso, claimed the men had been "treated fair and humanely", and that there was no record of either man complaining about his treatment. Though officials were informed by his F.B.I. handler that he was an informant after his first three weeks of detention, they decided that he still "posed a threat". He took notes on his imprisonment and smuggled them out in a Bible. Although denied legal representation at his detainment hearing on 24 April, he was allowed to attend it because he was an American. Two weeks into his detention, he was allowed to phone his fiancee in Chicago, who had already informed her Congressional representative of his apparent disappearance. He wrote ten letters home, one of which arrived in November 2006 dated 17 July. After three months, officials decided to release him after further review of his case. Legal case. On December 18, 2006, Vance filed suit against the US government and the former US Secretary of Defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, on grounds that he was tortured and his rights of habeas corpus were violated. He is being represented by Arthur Loevy, Jon Loevy and Michael Kanovitz of the law firm Loevy & Loevy. On September 21, 2007, Vance testified before a Senate Democratic Policy Committee on abuses in private security and reconstruction in Iraq during a hearing on Capitol Hill. He spoke about several events such as Shield Group Security brokering a deal with the South Korean government for small arms. He also spoke about Shield Group selling small arms to people operating within the U.S State Dept. During the proceeding Senator Byron Dorgan who chaired the committee asked Vance to turn over documents reflecting these weapon sales. Vance stated he would do so and also include hundreds of other pages including emails, photos and other documents reflecting SGS's criminal activities. On September 26, 2007 during an Appropriations Committee hearing, Senator Byron Dorgan asked Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates to investigate the detention of Donald Vance. Senator Dorgan also relayed during the committee hearing that he has submitted a request to the inspector generals office for a complete investigation. Sen. Dorgan called Vance's detention by the U.S military "frightening". On August 8, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago ruled that Vance and Nathan Ertel may proceed to sue Rumsfeld. Unless overturned, the ruling will allow these two plaintiffs to subpoena government documents and to compel sworn testimony about U.S. torture policies. In the past, courts have generally refrained from allowing such suits related to federal government conduct in zones of military conflict, granting government agents qualified immunity under the Bivens doctrine. In its opinion, the Court asked, "On what conceivable basis could a U.S. public official possibly conclude that it was constitutional to torture U.S. citizens?" With reference to the defendants' arguments for immunity, the Court wrote that "The [defense] theory would immunize every enlisted soldier in the war zone and every official in between ? for deliberate torture and even coldblooded murder of civilian U.S. citizens." In October of 2011, however, the 7th Circuit agreed to rehear the case en banc, vacating the prior opinion.

8501914	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_archery	Field archery. Field archery involves shooting at targets of varying (and often unmarked) distance, often in woodland and rough terrain. One goal of field archery is to improve the techniques and abilities required for bowhunting in a more realistic outdoor setting. As with golf, fatigue can be an issue as the athlete walks the distance between targets across sometimes rough terrain. Field Archery is usually shot according to either IFAA (International Field Archery Association) rules or to WA (World Archery Federation) rules. (see section on WA Field). Some national organisations (such as the NFAS in the UK) have their own rules. WA rounds consist of 24 targets, which may have marked or unmarked distances depending on the specific type of round. WA Field Archery is very popular in Western Europe whereas 3D is shot mostly in the Americas and Oceania. NFAA (USA). The NFAA is the US affiliate of the International Field Archery Association. Three common types of NFAA round are the field, hunter, and animal. A round consists of 28 targets in two units of 14. The information in the following sections is taken from the NFAA Styles and Rules. Field. Field rounds are at 'even' distances up to 80 yards (some of the shortest are measured in feet instead), using targets with a black bullseye (5 points), a white center (4) ring, and black outer (3) ring. Hunter. Hunter rounds use 'uneven' distances up to, and although scoring is identical to a field round, the target has an all-black face with a white bullseye. Child and youth positions for these two rounds are closer, no more than 30 and, respectively. Animal. Animal rounds use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round. The rules and scoring are also significantly different. The archer begins at the first station of the target and shoots his first arrow. If it hits, he does not have to shoot again. If it misses, he advances to station two and shoots a second arrow, then to station three for a third if needed. Scoring areas are vital (20, 16, or 12) and nonvital (18, 14, or 10) with points awarded depending on which arrow scored first. Again, children and youth shoot from reduced range. 3D. 3D archery is a subset of field archery focusing on shooting at life-size models of game, and is popular with hunters. It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition, albeit a more loosely organized form of competition than other types of field archery. On these animals there are 4 rings, only 3 of these are used in ASA shoots. The one that isn't used very often is the 14 ring. This can only be scored if you call it before you shoot, and even then it may not be allowed. Next is the 12 ring inside of the 10 ring, inside of the 8 ring. Anything on the target that is outside of the 8, 10, 12, or 14 rings is a 5. If you miss the target, you score a zero. Though the goal is hunting practice, hunting tips (broadheads) are not used, as they would tear up the foam targets too much. Normal target or field tips, of the same weight as the intended broadhead, are used instead. NFAS (UK). In the United Kingdom the NFAS (National Field Archery Society) sets the rules for many shoots including Big Game and 3D shoots. Most of these consist of 36 or 40 targets or 2x20 targets. The NFAS is not affiliated to any international organisation. The information in this section is taken from the NFAS Rules of Shooting. The most common NFAS rounds have a "walk-up" format where the archer starts at the furthest peg from the target and proceeds to nearer pegs if necessary. The first arrow is shot from the red peg (or sometimes wasp peg for compound). A hit in the kill zone scores 20 points (sometimes 24 if an inner kill zone is being used). A hit in the wound zone (anywhere outside the kill zone but not on antlers or base, or within wound lines on 2D targets) scores 16 points. If the scoring area is not hit with the first arrow the archer will proceed to the white peg for his/her second shot. A kill scores 14 points. A wound scores 10 points. If a third shot is needed the archer will proceed to the blue peg. A kill scores 8 points. A wound scores 4 points. If all 3 arrows miss the scoring zones the archer must stop shooting and a zero is scored for that target. Juniors 12-14 and 15-16 must shoot blue, yellow, yellow and white, blue, blue respectively. Cubs (under 12) shoot all their arrows from the closest yellow peg. All archers attending these shots must carry a valid NFAS card in order to shoot. There are multiple classes including compound limited, compound unlimited, bowhunter, barebow, freestyle, crossbow, hunting tackle, American flatbow and longbow. The traditional class is also accepted at some shoots. The information in this section is taken from the NFAS website, sections About the NFAS and NFAS The Rules. As part of the Constitution of the National Field Archery Society, an annual championship shall be held, open to members. The NFAS hold shoots throughout the year and all over the country. They currently (2012) hold three championships, open to eligible members. 3D Championships - Bank Holiday weekend, end of May National Champs - 3rd weekend in September To be eligible to shoot a Championships, NFAS members must have competed in three open shoots in the bow style that they wish to shoot, or a previous Championships and existing members must have renewed their membership by the 31st of March. WA Field. The information in this section is taken from Book 4 of the WA Constitution & Rules. The World Archery Federation, commonly known as WA and formerly as FITA (F?d?ration Internationale de Tir ? l'Arc), defines a suite of rounds based on a 24-target course. Four target face sizes are specified: 80?cm; 60?cm; 40?cm and 20?cm. Six target faces of each size are used on the course. For each target face size there are upper and lower distance limits for the various divisions of archer. Target faces have four black outer rings and a yellow spot, each with an equal width. The yellow spot is subdivided into two rings. The black rings score 1 point for the outermost to 4 points for the innermost. A hit in the outer yellow scores 5 points. A hit in the inner yellow scores 6 points. Before April 2008, the innermost yellow ring counted as an X (the number of Xs was used for tie-breaks) but only scored 5 points. The UK operates some variations on this for junior archers. When shooting marked distances, the distance to the target is shown on each peg. On unmarked distances, the distance is not shown. A WA 24 Marked round is shot on a single day using 24 targets at marked distances only. A WA 24 Unmarked round is shot on a single day using 24 targets at unmarked distances only. A WA 24 Mixed round is shot on a single day using 12 targets at marked distances and 12 targets at unmarked distances. A WA Combined Field round consists of a WA 24 Unmarked round shot on one day and a WA 24 Marked round shot on the same course the following day with the distances having been increased. WA rules state that the lanes between the shooting positions and the targets must not be obstructed by branches or tree trunks. Archers follow the course in groups of between two and four. The pegs are arranged so that two people can shoot from one peg at the same time. Each archer shoots three arrows at each target, making a round of 72 arrows.

It is best known for its lugubrious Chapel of the Bones. This huge church was built in Gothic style (with some Manueline influences) between 1475 and the 1550s to the design of Martim Louren?o, replacing an earlier Romanesque church of 1226. This church is one of a kind through its narthex with arcades in front of the church. The arcade is formed by seven arches with different forms (semicircular, pointed or horseshoe arches), a typical blend of Gothic and Moorish elements. The battlemented fa?ade has conical or spiral-shaped spires. The Manueline entrance to the church carries above a pelican, emblem of king Jo?o II and an armillary, emblem of king Manuel I. The church shows majestic proportions: 36 x 34 x 24 m. The single, groin-vaulted nave gives a wide impression, accentuated by the white mortar on the walls and the columns. This is the largest nave of this kind to be found in Portuguese churches. The spacious vault of the crossing rests on ogival arches. The father of Portuguese drama Gil Vicente is buried at the left side of the entrance. The chancel (early 16th century) with the main altar (from a later date) displays Renaissance features. But the choir stalls were made in different art styles: the right one in Renaissance, the left in Baroque style. The altars in the transept are decorated with gilded sculpturework ("talha dourada") framing 16th century panels, probably painted by Flemish artists. The sides of the nave contain twelve open chapels, built between the buttresses of the wall.

October 10, 1946 in England), a popular British author of over 160 romance novels. She also signed novels as Caroline Fleming and Cardine Fleming. Mildred Grieveson began to write down stories in her childhood years. The first novel that she actually finished, "Caroline" (1965), was also her first book to be published. Her novel, "Leopard in the Snow" (1974), was developed into a 1978 film. Personal life. Mildred Grieveson was born on October 10, 1946 in England. She always wanted to write, and for years she wrote for her own pleasure.

Her mother used to gather these up from time to time, when her bedroom became too untidy, and disposed of these manuscripts. Mildred married very young and became a housewife. Her husband suggested that she ought to send one of her stories to a publisher, but she had never finished one of her stories. Published at 19, she was newly married, and her daughter was just a baby, when she juggled her household chores and scribbled away in exercise books every chance she got. Now, she has two adult children, a son and a daughter, and two grandchildren, Abigail and Ben. Writing career. With her husband's encouragement, she finally finished a manuscript, "Caroline". When she was only 19, in 1965, Mills & Boon published "Caroline", and this became her first published book, signed under the pseudonym Anne Mather. The first novel to be issued entirely through M&B was Dangerous Enchantment in May 1969. (ref. Fantastc Fiction website).** In 1973, she became a launch author for the new Harlequin Presents line of category romance novels. Harlequin Presents books were more sensual than the previous line, Harlequin Romance, under which Anne Mather had been published. She was chosen to be a launch author because she, along with Violet Winspear and Anne Hampson were the most popular and prolific of Harlequin's authors. Her novel, "Leopard in the Snow" (1974), was developed into a 1978 movie.
8502209	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFLA-TV	CFLA-TV. CFLA-TV was the local CBC Television station in Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It was an analogue rebroadcaster of CBNT-DT, the CBC station in St. John's. 1950s to 1970s. The station was founded by the US Air Force in 1957 via a Canada-United States agreement. The station's licence was held by the CBC (making it a CBC owned and operated television station), but it was maintained and operated by the USAF. The station was broadcast on VHF Channel 8 with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 348 watts (video) and 174 watts (audio). Programming. During the USAF's operation under CBC licensing, the programming became more varied. At that point in time, material was shipped to the CFLA studios from both the CBC and American Forces Network suppliers. Content was aired 50/50. In order to provide more American content, CFLA created a one hour teen dance show, similar to "American Bandstand". The "Jeffrey Wayne Show" was broadcast three times a week with both American and Canadian teenagers participating from Happy Valley and Northwest River. Under the CBC rules, this locally produced show counted as Canadian content, allowing the addition of three hours of American content. During the early 1960s, CFLA's programming schedule usually ran from 2:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Two local newscasts were presented Monday - Saturday, and one on Sunday. The news copy was ripped and read off the wire, and visuals consisted of still pictures. The weatherman stood behind a large transparent glass map. By reversing the camera scanning it appeared that he had the special talent of writing and drawing the symbols backwards. It created much viewer interest, so much so that it was a top priority of many visitors to the station to see how it was done. The management in 1969 was M.A. "Tony" Grace as the CBC Management Representative, SSgt. Tom Stevenson as USAF NCOIC (General Manager), and Sgt. Jon "Dunbar" Wakayama as Program Director. During their tenure, CFLA created four different block programming formats, recruited local talent to sing jingles for the station, integrated the "CBC is for Lovers" TV campaign, and even had a parade rerouted to a road near the studio in order to broadcast the event. The CFLA-TV crew also produced a weekly news radio feature called "Pulsebeat" for CFGB-AM in Happy Valley. Since there was no network feed or videotape in 1969 to show the moon landing, the CFLA-TV crew rebroadcast the live CBC radio feed over an artistically selected series of slides to capture the feeling of that historical moment. A similar situation seven years earlier in 1962 during John F. Kennedy's historic Bay Of Pigs speech; the audio portion was picked up from CFGB radio while various file pictures of the president aired. The CBC also helped the station by sending cyclorama backdrops, set dressing, props and slides for the regularly scheduled news and entertainment programs such as "Panorama" and "Speaking of Sports with Gordie Rendell". They also provided an environmentally conscious news teletype, allowing viewers to follow the events of mercury poisoning of the fish in Placentia Bay. Because the CBC's time-sensitive programs had to be delayed by several weeks, viewers were treated to situations such as the Perry Como Thanksgiving Special airing close to Christmas. Since the majority of Christmas specials were pre-produced they aired on time. To keep the Canadian content balance, 55-45 at that time, CFLA produced a live show Monday - Saturday at 11:40 p.m. called "Midnight". Hosted by Marty Culpepper, it basically was a radio show on TV, consisting of music recordings over still pictures, a filmed short subject, cartoon, news headlines and tidbits off the wire. Saturday afternoons, during the winter months, a one hour teen dance show hosted by Mike Keene was produced locally. Occasionally, courtesy of the NCO Club, their entertainment provided several half-hour shows. It was a challenge to produce a show with a live band and singers in such a small studio with limited equipment. Operations. The studio was located in the basement of building S565. The transmitter, two studio cameras and switcher were Dage products. Telecine consisted of two 16mm RCA projectors and a 35mm slide projector. No videotape. Leo Harvey was the CBC Mgt. Rep. and Capt. William James, base information officer, was the military supervisor. The equipment for CFLA-TV originally was located at Loring AFB, Maine during 1954-56 due to the lack of commercial service in that area. The station was relocated to Goose Air Base once Presque Isle's WAGM-TV began broadcasting on channel 8 in 1956. 1970s to present. In 1973, the USAF formally transferred operations to the CBC. On March 1, 1988, the station's licence was renewed. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) also noted that CFLA was basically a rebroadcast transmitter of CBNT St. John's, aside from 3 hours and 20 minutes of locally-produced programming each week. Most of this programming was a ten-minute insert of the daily news and public affairs program "Here and Now" (from CBNT), and a 30-minute news and general interest program "Coffee Break", which aired on weekday mornings. Starting October 8, 1991, CFLA-TV was given approval to decrease its ERP from 6800 to 1930 watts. With this change, a new antenna system was installed, and the station became a full-time rebroadcaster of CBNT. Due to budget cuts handed down on the CBC in April 2012, the CBC has announced several austerity measures to keep the corporation solvent and in operation; this included the closure of the CBC and Radio-Canada's remaining analogue transmitters, including CFLA-TV, on July 31, 2012.

It is based on the true story of Kimberly Mays and Arlena Twigg, babies switched soon after birth in a Florida hospital in 1978. Plot. When Arlena Twigg becomes ill, a blood test reveals that she is not the biological daughter of Regina and Ernest Twigg. When Arlena dies at the age of nine, her parents search for their biological daughter who is being raised as Kimberly Mays. Factual basis. Kimberly Mays and Arlena Twigg were born within a few days of each other in a Wauchula, Florida hospital in November 1978. Kimberly went home with Bob Mays and his wife, Barbara, who died of ovarian cancer when Kimberly was three. Ernest and Regina Twigg of Sebring, Florida took home the Mays' biological daughter, whom they named Arlena. The Twiggs learned that Arlena had the wrong blood type to be their biological daughter at age 9. Following Arlena's death, the Twiggs sought information about their biological daughter and located Kimberly Mays, who was later the subject of a custody battle between her biological parents, and Bob Mays, the man who raised her after she was switched at birth. Bob Mays had agreed in 1989 to grant the Twiggs visitation rights to Kimberly, but later cut off the visits. The Twiggs then sued for increased visitation or custody of Kimberly. A Wauchula, Florida circuit court ruled in 1993 that Kimberly would be allowed to cut off all contacts with her biological family and that Bob Mays was her psychological father. Though Kimberly won the right to stay with Bob Mays, she later ran away and moved in with the Twiggs. Her early adulthood was troubled, as she battled marital woes and lost custody of her own child for a time. The court battle was also the subject of a book entitled "The Baby Swap Conspiracy" by Loretta Schwarz-Nobel. Barbara Mays's parents' surname name was changed from Coker to Hill in the film.
8502272	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engels-2	Engels-2. Engels Air Force Base (also given as Engels-2 or Engel's) is a strategic air base in Russia located east of Saratov. Engels is a major bomber operations base, and is Russia's sole operating location for the Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers. The base contains a runway and about 10 large revetments. It is named after the Communist philosopher, Friedrich Engels. History. In 1930, 1.5?km from the town of Engels, in a vacant lot, the construction of a military pilots school began. The 14th School of Pilots was activated at Engels on December 15, 1930. Around 10,000 people worked on the site. On February 16, 1932 the first airplane, a Polikarpov U-2 used the site. Reportedly that same day the school was renamed the Engels School of Pilots. By 1936 the Engels military aviation school was one of the best flight schools in the country. Students flew Polikarpov U-2, Polikarpov R-5 and CSS aircraft. Prior to the Second World War the school trained several thousand pilots. Many of them fought in the Spanish Civil War, participated in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol and the Soviet-Finnish War (1939-1940). For participation in the fighting seven pupils were named Heroes of the Soviet Union. At the beginning of the Second World War the school had in service Polikarpov U-2, ANT-40, Pe-2, and others aircraft. During the war years the Engels Flying School sent to the front 14 regiments. Among them were three women's regiments (including the Night Witches), in which served Major Marina Raskova. 190 pupils of the school were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for combat exploits. In the early 1950s, the construction of the new "Engels-2" airport with a concrete runway with a length of 3?km and a width of 100m was begun, and therefore, by September 1954 the Engels school was moved to the city of Tambov. On December 15, 1954, the 201st Heavy Bomber Aviation Division was established, comprising the 79th, 1096th and 1230th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiments (TBAPs). The personnel of the regiments was assembled by choosing the best specialists of the Long Range Aviation, graduates of military schools and academies. The first Myasishchev M-4 bombers arrived in Engels on February 28, 1955. In May 1957 the first modernised 3M bomber arrived. In 1957, the 79th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment was transferred to Ukrainka and was transferred to the 73rd Heavy Bomber Aviation Division. Gradually the M-4 and 3M bombers were converted into aerial refuelling tankers. Air refueling significantly increased the range of the bombers, which expanded their capacity. Around 1960, the 1230th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment was renamed the 1230th Aviation Regiment Air Refueling. The 3M bombers were part of Long Range Aviation until 1985, and then were destroyed in accordance with the agreement on the reduction of offensive weapons. The 3MS-II and 3MN-II, converted into tankers, were in service for much longer - up to the end of 1993 and before being replaced by the more advanced Il-78. The base was to have received the first production Tu-160 in 1987 but it went to Priluki, whose units had Tupolev Tu-22M experience. The first three Tu-160s not at Pryluky were incorporated into the 1096th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment in 1992. By 1994 Engels had five Tu-160 bombers in operation, and that same year the 1096th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment was redesiganted the 121st Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, adopting its colours and traditions. In 1998 the START I treaty exchange of information had shown it had 20 operational Tupolev Tu-95 bombers and six Tu-160 bombers, all with cruise missile capability. From 1999 to 2001 the base received eight Tu-160s from Ukraine paid for by gas price reductions. The last two arrived on 21 February 2001. The 184th Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation REgiment was reformed at the base on 1 September 2000, drawing on Tu-95MS aircraft transferred from Mozdok. By 2007 the base had 14 Tu-160 bombers, 20 Tu-95 bombers and an unknown number of Tu-22M bombers. Aircraft. The 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division of the 37th Air Army controlled operations at the base up until the Air Force reorganisation of 2009-10.

Johnny Loftus of Allmusic gave the EP three and a half stars out of five, remarking that "[Good Riddance's] tightly wound sound is well represented here; 'Judas and the Morning After Pill' and 'Grandstanding from the Cheap Seats' have an urgent punk traditionalism about them that's reminiscent of Bad Religion. For their part, Kill Your Idols prove that the rabid, ragged-edges sound of New York City's defiant hardcore scene is still going strong."
8502304	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_in_motoring	1997 in motoring. 1997 in motoring deals with developments in the automotive industry that occurred throughout the year 1997 by various automobile manufacturers, grouped by country. The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles, and is one of the Earth's most important economic sectors by revenue. United Kingdom. A year after launching the Ka city car, Ford has spawned another car from its Fiesta chassis in the shape of the Puma - a 2+2 compact sports coupe with quirky but distinctive styling. Its entry-level 1.4 16-valve Zetec engine is sourced from the Fiesta, but the larger 1.7 unit is seen only in the Puma and is significantly more powerful than the Fiesta-sourced engine. The Puma handles better than just about any other front-wheel drive car currently on sale in Britain, and its only real criticism is the shortage of space in the rear seats. Vauxhall has pulled the plug on production of its Calibra coupe range after eight years. It has no immediate successor, though there are long-term plans for a coupe version of the next generation Astra hatchback. Italy. The European Car of the Year award for 1998 goes to the Alfa Romeo 156. It is a sporty-looking four-door saloon aimed directly at the class-leading likes of the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. As a rival for its dominant German competitors, the Alfa is hard to beat when it comes to style, refinement and driver appeal. Equipment levels are also good and the Alfa is one of the most competitively priced cars in its sector. In fact it is more comparable with the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Vectra when it comes to pricing. The four-door saloon is the only model in the current 156 range, but a "Sportwagon" estate car is proposed for a later date. Fiat has facelifted the Cinquecento city car after six years on sale and given it a new name - Seicento. The Seicento is a reworking of its predecessor with curvier detailing replacing the old car's boxy looks, with the bog-standard 700cc engine being dropped and the continuing 900cc unit being available with clever "Citymatic" semi-automatic transmission - with a normal manual-style gear-lever but no clutch. France. Citro?n is calling time on ZX production after seven years to make way for an all-new car - the Xsara. The Xsara is a conventionally styled hatchback which offers very little to set the pulse racing, but has plenty of appeal for customers who have less interest in cars. Its asking price is competitive, running costs are low, and the interior offers good levels of space and comfort. The 1.9 diesel engine is particularly refined and economical. The hatchbacks and estate are practical and comfortable family cars, while the coupe - in reality little more than a three-door hatchback - offers a powerful 2.0 "VTS" version which is capable of nearly 140mph. A mini-MPV, in the style of Renault's recent Megane Scenic, is expected in two years. Germany. The Volkswagen Golf has entered its fourth generation in the most upmarket form seen yet. It has the look of its predecessor, but in reality is an all-new car. The latest Golf will initially be sold as a hatchback only, with estate and cabriolet versions expected in 1998. Entry-level Golfs use 1.4 and 1.6 petrol engines as well as a 1.9 diesel, with more expensive versions including the 1.9 turbo-diesel as well as the four GTI models - 1.8 non-turbo, 1.8 turbo, 2.0 and 2.3 V5. The Golf's interior is well-equipped and upmarket, which justifies its higher asking price than other similar-sized cars. A saloon version - the Bora - replaces the Vento next year, and promises to be more of a car in its own right than the "Golf-with-a-boot" image that always let down the Golf-based Jettas and Ventos. Audi has canned the 100 nameplate after 29 years and replaced it with the nametag A6. Designed as a direct competitor for the BMW 5 Series, the A6 is a stylish, comfortable, solid and refined saloon and estate ("Avant") range that looks just the part to complete the recent turnaround at Audi which has seen its desirability surge and become at least a match for its key rivals from BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz has hit the headlines with two innovative new models. The first is the A-Class, its first front-wheel drive car. But the most significant thing about the German marque's new entry-level model is its clever one-cube design which allows plenty of interior space thanks to its high roof on a chassis the size of a mini-cars. The other addition to the Mercedes range is the SLK - a two-seater sports car with a folding convertible-style steel roof and a supercharged 2.3 litre engine capable of 150mph. It is designed as a direct competitor to two new rival sports cars that have recently come from Germany - the Porsche Boxster and BMW Z3. Japan. Two of Japan's most famous nameplates - Honda's Accord and Toyota's Corolla - were updated for 1998. Neither model is particularly exciting or distinctive, but they both look set to perpetuate their long-standing reputations for excellent build quality and reliability.

The Doncaster Panthers Basketball Club was established in 1954 by Morris Wordsworth and played out of Balby High School Gym in their formative years and gained entry to the elite National Basketball League (NBL) in 1973 playing as Wilson Panthers. This was the NBL's second year of its existence and in 1987 it became the British Basketball League (BBL). After competing professionally, the team withdrew from the NBL in 1985 and the club ceased to exist. In the NBL the Panthers played out of Adwick Leisure Centre, Doncaster and later out of The Concord Sports Centre, Sheffield. During their 12 years in the NBL the Panthers (Men), playing as Team Ziebart, won the NBL and National Cup in season 1978-79, and were National Cup finalists playing as John Carr Panthers, for the next two seasons.

It is located between Heidelberg and Sinsheim in the Rhein-Neckar district in the state of Baden-W?rttemberg. History. In 772 and 822 Meckesheim was mentioned for the first times as "Heim des Mechino" ("home of Mechino") or "Mechinos Heim" ("Mechino's home") in the Codex of Lorsch. The Martin's Chappel which ruins are east of the village is one of the oldest churches in the region. Since 1330 Meckesheim and the villages around was a part of the Electorate of the Palatinate. After the end of this territory in 1803 the village became a part of Baden. Traffic (rail). Meckesheim is connected via the Badenian Odenwald line from Heidelberg (1862, northwestern of Meckesheim) to Mosbach(Baden) (eastwards, 1862) and W?rzburg (completed 1866). In 1868, a branch to Bad Rappenau (southeast of Meckesheim, important for salt production in Baden) was added and in 1869 completed to Bad Friedrichshall-Jagstfeld, in this way there were now a direct connection to Stuttgart via Heilbronn, too. In 1902, a normal gauge minor railway westwards to station Wiesloch-Walldorf on Baden Mainline was opened, but the Meckesheim-- section already 1922 closed. During WWII the line eastbound became a trunk due to retreating German troops, and in 1971 the line was shortened till Aglasterhausen. Since 2009 and 2010, these two lines (Elsenztalbahn and Badische Schwarzbachtalbahn) are incorporated into the rapid suburban system Rhein-Neckar-S-Bahn. Due to the branching Schwarzbach valley line and an amount of passengers in the village, Meckesheim is also a halt (since 1997) in the RE-train system between Mannheim, Heidelberg, and Heilbronn. In this way you can reach Heidelberg Central station (distance 23?km = 13.75 miles) within 17 minutes. As DB Netz (the organization owning the railway tracks) refused during planning the S-Bahn to incorporate capacities for goods trains and (even, if already existing!) sidings, goods traffic ceased in the late 2000s.
8502322	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Mr._Polly_(film)	The History of Mr. Polly (film). "The History of Mr. Polly" is a 1949 British film, based on the 1910 comic novel "The History of Mr. Polly" by H.G. Wells. It was directed by Anthony Pelissier (who is also credited with the script) and stars John Mills, Betty Ann Davies, Megs Jenkins and Finlay Currie. It was the first adaptation of one of Wells' work to be produced after his death in 1946. Plot. Alfred Polly (John Mills) is a day-dreamer with his nose in books rather than keeping his mind on his work. Following his dismissal from a draper's shop, where his father had placed him as an apprentice, he finds it hard to find another position. When a telegram arrives informing him of his father's death, he returns to the family home. With a bequest of ?500, Polly starts to think about what he should now do with his life, and a friend of his father's, Mr Johnsen (Edward Chapman), urges him to invest it in a shop - an idea that Polly hates. Whilst dawdling in the country on a newly-bought bicycle, Polly meets, and has a brief dalliance with, a schoolgirl, Christabel (Sally Ann Howes). It can't last, and eventually he marries a cousin, Miriam Larkins (Betty Ann Davies), whom he met at his father's wake. It is not a marriage of love, but one of convenience. 15 years pass and Polly and his wife are running a drapers in Fishbourne. Polly hates the shop and the marriage has descended to incessant arguments and bickering. Whilst walking in the country to get away from his wife, Polly decides to commit suicide but also sets his shop ablaze in the hope the insurance will set Miriam straight. He botches the arson job and instead of killing himself, rescues an elderly neighbour and becomes a minor local celebrity. Still unhappy, Polly decides to simply leave Miriam; he walks out and finds his way into the country where he comes across an inn on a riverside. The innkeeper (Megs Jenkins) is seeking a handyman and ferryman. Polly takes the job, but soon realises that the position was open because the innkeeper's brother-in-law is a drunkard who chases any other man away from the inn. Polly ends up having a few run-ins with Uncle Jim (Finlay Currie), who finally accidentally trips and drowns in a weir when he is chasing Polly. Polly returns to work in the inn. Several years later, he wonders whether Miriam is getting by. He returns to Fishbourne to find that she has opened a tea-shop with her sister, in the belief that Polly had drowned (Uncle Jim had been wearing a pair of trousers with Polly's name in them when he died). He runs into his ex-wife whilst exiting the tea-shop; she thinks she recognises him and shrinks away in fear, but Polly quietly leaves and returns to his happier life at the inn.

Born in New York City, he covered international affairs for more than three decades at CBS News, NBC News and "The New York Times". Nearly half that time he was based abroad in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Paris and Saigon. Near the end of his tenure at the "Times", Mr. Kalb received a fellowship from the Council on Foreign Relations - awarded annually to a foreign correspondent - and took a leave from the newspaper for a year. He also won an Overseas Press Club Award for a 1968 documentary on the Vietcong. He and his younger brother, journalist Marvin Kalb traveled extensively with Henry Kissinger on diplomatic missions and later wrote a biography together entitled "Kissinger." The two brothers also co-authored "The Last Ambassador", a novel about the collapse of Saigon in 1975. In 1984 Kalb was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and spokesman for the State Department. It was the first time that a journalist who covered the State Department has been named as its spokesman. Kalb quit this post two years later to protest what he called "the reported disinformation program" conducted by the Reagan Administration against the Libyan leader Col. Muammar al-Gaddafi. Today, Kalb travels widely as a lecturer and moderator. He was the founding anchor and a panelist on the weekly CNN program "Reliable Sources" for a decade.

What distinguishes it from a raunchy sex show is Eyen's clever dialogue and witty observations, which impressed even mainstream critics when it first was staged near the end of the sexual revolution that started in the 1960s. Directed by Eyen, "The Dirtiest Show in Town" opened on June 27, 1970 at the off-Broadway Astor Place Theatre, where it ran for 509 performances. It subsequently toured and then was staged at the West End's Duchess Theatre, where it ran for nearly 800 performances. Another production opened at the Ivar Theater in Los Angeles in 1971, starring Michael Kearns and Eyen's muse Sharon Barr. In 1975, Eyen and Henry Krieger put together a version called "The Dirtiest Musical in Town" starring Nell Carter. In 1980, Eyen directed a film version of the play for the cable TV network Showtime, making it the first "made for cable TV" movie ever produced. The updated storyline for this film version revolves around members of a New York City gym obsessing about their life situations, eventually leading up to the gay and straight characters writhing together in an orgy. It starred Sharon Barr and a young John Wesley Shipp.
8502356	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epfenbach	Epfenbach. Epfenbach is a municipality in south western Germany. It is located between Heidelberg and Sinsheim in the Rhein-Neckar district in the state of Baden-W?rttemberg. The municipality belongs to the municipal association of Waibstadt and the tourist region Brunnenregion ("Water Spring Region"). The meaning of the name "Epfenbach" is disputed. It could be derived from a person or plant name. Geography. Epfenbach is in Kraichgau on the edge of the little Odenwald. History. Epfenbach first appears in documents in the year 1286 as "Epphinbach" on a bestowal document of the Sch?nau Abbey. In 1325, the manor was sold to the Archbishopric of Mainz and then resold in 1344 to the knight Engelhard von Hirschhorn. In the centuries to follow, ownership of the manor changed often. In 1622, Count Tilly burned down the village. In 1643, the Johannes-Kirche ("Church of Saint John") in Epfenbach was besieged by 400 horsemen of Lorraine. Legend has it that the Schulthei? at the time, one Hans Dengel, was shot in the head and killed during this siege. By end of the Thirty Years' War, only 15 of the 72 original inhabitants still lived in the village. In 1796, Carl Ullmann was born. Carl was named by the Grand Duke of Baden as prelate and director of the high church council of the State Church of Baden in 1857. In 1799, the village was plundered by French troops. Later in 1812, citizens of Epfenbach took part in the French invasion of Russia (1812) under Napoleon. At least Chr. Zapf came back alive. Two years after the union of Lutheran churches in Baden ("Evangelischen Kirchenunion") in 1823, the reformed and the Lutheran schools were combined. In 1876, the "Simultanschule" was instituted.

The flag is blue and white and was awarded in 1978. Culture and sights. The Epfenbach Museum of Local History shows how a farm household looked around the year 1850. Displayed are things such as the clothes and tools of the local farmers and craftsmen.

8502410	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_I._King_Library	Margaret I. King Library. The Margaret I. King Library consisted of three contiguous buildings at the University of Kentucky. A southern and northern addition were added to the original building. History. The first library at the University of Kentucky was the 2,500 sq. ft. Carnegie library. Constructed in 1909 with a $26,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie, it was operated by Margaret I. King, the University's first librarian who was also secretary to the University's first President, James Patterson. It had an annual book budget of $2,000. Before the library's construction, volumes and materials had to be checked out from Patterson's personal collection. Between 1910 and 1928, the number of volumes in the library grew from 3,000 to 100,000. By 1925, the number of people employed at the library was just six. In 1929, construction began on the University Library due to the rapid growth and success of the Carnegie Library. Then-University of Kentucky President Frank L. McVey was pushing for the "little college" to transform into a "true university." The completion of the 250,000 volume $450,000 facility in 1931 was funded entirely from existing University funds as the state failed to provide adequate monies towards the construction. The library was designed to be expanded ten years after its opening. In 1941, the expansion for the library that was once planned was halted by World War II. In 1947, Margaret King retired from her post at the library after four decades. In honor of her service to the public, the University renamed the University Library the Margaret I. King Library. By the mid-1950s, however, the library was beginning to show its age and was quickly running out of room for the more than 250,000 volumes it was holding. In 1960, then-University of Kentucky President Frank G. Dickey proposed a new library but did not receive any assurance from the state's General Assembly that funding would be appropriated. It also received a flat response from then-Director of Libraries at the University, Lawrence Thompson, who was more interested in developing special collections than expanding the facility. In 1962, a compromise was reached for a $2 million addition to the southern side of the building. It was completed in 1963, however, the floor levels did not match those in the original library. As a result, navigating between the two libraries became a chore and the maze of corridors, stairwells and stacks became known as a maze. Record attendance during the late-1960s and early-1970's required the construction of another addition. Constructed in 1974, the Margaret I. King Library North was a $4 million addition to the north of the original facility that housed special collections, periodicals and administrative offices. It included an overhead pedestrian crossing between the original library and the new addition. Construction on this was spearheaded by then-President Otis A. Singletary. Today. In April 1998, the William T. Young Library opened and by May, most of the functions of the King Library had been relocated. Today, the King Library is home to Special Collections and Digital Programs, the Geological Sciences Library and Map Collection, the King Library Press, several library support offices and the School of Library and Information Science. King North became the Lucille Caudill Little Fine Arts Library and Learning Center. In 1999, the bridge that connected the former King North to the original King Library was removed. One year later, the Little Fine Arts Library was extensively renovated.

Each patrol boat was armed with a single 40 mm Bofors gun as main armament, supplemented by two .50 cal Browning machineguns and an 81-mm mortar, although the mortar was removed from all ships sometime after 1988. The main weapon was originally to be two 30-mm guns on a twin-mount, but the reconditioned Bofors were selected to keep costs down; provision was made to install an updated weapon later in the class' service life, but this did not eventuate. "Dubbo" was laid down by North Queensland Engineers and Agents at Cairns, Queensland on 9 August 1982. She was launched on 21 January 1984 in the presence of Thomas Arthur Slattery and Joan Slattery, then Mayor and Mayoress of Dubbo, and commissioned into the RAN on 10 March 1984. Fate.

The article includes discussion of the Targums, Mishna, and Talmuds, which are not regarded as Bible commentaries in the modern sense of the word, but which provide the foundation for later commentary. With the exception of these classical Jewish works, this article focuses on Christian Biblical commentaries; for more on Jewish Biblical commentaries, see Jewish commentaries on the Bible. Philo. That Greek literature, in general, got its inspiration from Moses was an uncritical idea that dated back as far as Philo, the great Jewish writer of Alexandria. A visitor to Alexandria at the time when Christ was preaching in Galilee would find there and in its vicinity a million Jews using the Septuagint as their Bible, and could enter their magnificent Great Synagogue of which they were justly proud. Whoever had not seen it was not supposed to have beheld the glory of Israel. The members of their Sanhedrin, according to Sukkah, were seated on seventy-one golden thrones valued at tens of thousands of talents of gold; and the building was so vast that a flag had to be waved to show the people when to respond. At the head of this assembly, on the highest throne, was seated Alexander the Alabarch, the brother of Philo. Philo himself was a man of wealth and learning, who mingled with all classes of men and frequented the theatre and the great library. Equally at home in the Septuagint and the Greek classics, he was struck and perplexed by the many beautiful and noble thoughts contained in the latter, which could bear comparison with many passages of the Bible. As this difficulty must have frequently presented itself to the minds of his coreligionists, he endeavoured to meet it by saying that all that was great in Socrates, Plato, etc. originated with Moses. He set about reconciling Pagan philosophy with the Old Testament, and for this purpose he made extensive use of the allegorical method of interpretation. He taught that many passages of the Pentateuch were not intended to be taken literally. In fact, he said that they were literally false, but allegorically true. He did not make the distinction between natural and revealed religion. For example, Pagan systems may have natural religion highly developed, but, from a Judeo-Christian point of view, with much concomitant error. His exegesis served to tide over the difficulty for the time amongst the Hellenistic Jews, and had great influence on Origen of Alexandria and other Alexandrian Christian writers. The Targums. Farrar, in his "Life of Christ", says that it has been suggested that when Christ visited the Temple, at twelve years of age, there may have been present among the doctors Jonathan ben Uzziel, once thought the author of the Yonathan Targum, and the venerable teachers Hillel and Shammai, the handers-on of the Mishna. The Targums (the most famous of which is that on the Pentateuch erroneously attributed to Onkelos, a misnomer for Aquila, according to Abrahams) were the only approach to anything like a commentary on the Bible before the time of Christ. They were interpretative translations or paraphrases from Hebrew into Aramaic for the use of the synagogues when, after the Exile, the people had lost the knowledge of Hebrew. It is doubtful whether any of them were committed to writing before the Christian Era. They are important as indicating the character of the Hebrew text used, and because they agree with the New Testament in interpreting certain passages Messianically which later Jews denied to have any Messianic bearing. The Mishna and Talmuds. Hillel and Shammai were the last "pair" of several generations of "pairs" of teachers. These pairs were the successors of the early scribes who lived after the Exile. These teachers are said to have handed down and expanded the Oral Law, which, according to the uncritical view of many Jews, began with Moses. This Oral Law, whose origin is buried in obscurity, consists of legal and liturgical interpretations and applications of the Pentateuch. As no part of it was written down, it was preserved by constant repetition (Mishna). On the destruction of Jerusalem several rabbis, learned in this Law, settled at Jamnia, near the sea, twenty-eight miles west of Jerusalem. Jamnia became the head-quarters of Jewish learning until AD 135, due to the Third Jewish Revolt. Then schools were opened at Sepphoris and Tiberias to the west of the Sea of Galilee. The rabbis comforted their countrymen by teaching that the study of the Law (Oral as well as Written) took the place of the sacrifices. They devoted their energies to arranging the Unwritten Torah, or Law. One of the most successful at this was Rabbi Akiba who took part in the Third Jewish Revolt of Bar Kochba, against the Romans, and lost his life (135). The work of systematization was completed and probably committed to writing by the Jewish patriarch at Tiberias, Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi "The Prince" (150-210). He was of noble birth, wealthy, learned, and is called by the Jews "Our Master the Saint" or simply Rabbi par excellence. The compilation made by this Rabbi is the Mishna. It is written in New Hebrew, and consists of six great divisions or orders, each division containing, on an average, about ten tractates, each tractate being made up of several chapters. The Mishna may be said to be a compilation of Jewish traditional moral theology, liturgy, law, etc. There were other traditions not embodied in the work of Rabbi, and these are called additional Mishna. The discussions of later generations of rabbis all centred round the text of the Mishna. Interpreters or "speakers" laboured upon it both in Jerusalem and Babylonia (until 500), and the results are comprised in the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. The word Talmud means teaching, doctrine. Each Talmud consists of two parts, the Mishna (in Hebrew), in sixty-three tractates, and an explanation of the same (Gemara), ten or twelve times as long. The explanatory portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is written in NeoWestern Aramaic and that of the Babylonian Talmud in Eastern Aramaic, which is closely allied to Syriac or Mandaic. The passages in the Gemara containing additional Mishna are, however, given in New Hebrew. Only thirty-nine tractates of the Mishna have Gemara. The Talmud, then, consists of the Mishna (traditions from 450 BC till 200 AD), together with a commentary thereon, Gemara, the latter being composed about 200-500 AD. Next to the Bible the Babylonian Talmud is the great religious book of orthodox Jews, though the Palestinian Talmud is more highly prized by modern scholars. From the year 500 till the Middle Ages the rabbis (geonim) in Babylonia and elsewhere were engaged in commenting on the Talmud and reconciling it with the Bible. A list of such commentaries is given in "The Jewish Encyclopedia". The Midrashim. Simultaneously with the Mishna and Talmud there grew up a number of Midrashim, or commentaries on the Bible. some of these were legalistic, like the halakhic sections of the Talmud but the most important were of an edifying, homiletic character (Midrash Aggadah). These latter, although chronologically later, are important for the corroborative light which they throw on the language of the New Testament. The Gospel of St. John is seen to be steeped in early Jewish phraseology, and the words of Ps. cix Hebrew Bible 110], "The Lord said to my Lord", etc. are in one place applied to the Messiah, as they are in St. Matthew, though Rashi following the Rabbis interpreted the words in the sense of applying them to Abraham. Karaite commentators. Anan ben David, a prominent Babylonian Jew in the eighth century, rejected Rabbinism for the written Old Testament and became the founder of the sect known a Karaites (a word indicating their preference for the written Bible). This schism produced great energy and ability on both sides. The principal Karaite Bible commentators were Nahavendi (ninth century); Abu al-Faraj Harun (ninth century), exegete and Hebrew grammarian; Solomon ben Yerucham (tenth century); Sahal ben Mazliach (died 950), Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer; Joseph al-Bazir (died 930); Japhet ben Ali, the greatest Karaite commentator of the tenth century; and Judah Hadassi (died 1160). Middle Ages. Saadiah of Fay?m (died 892), the most powerful writer against the Karaites, translated the Bible into Arabic and added notes. Besides commentaries on the Bible, Saadiah wrote a systematic treatise bringing revealed religion into harmony with Greek philosophy. He thus became the forerunner of Maimonides and the Catholic Schoolmen. Solomon ben Isaac, called Rashi (born 1040) wrote very popular explanations of the Talmud and the Bible. Abraham Ibn Ezra of Toledo (died 1168) had a good knowledge of Oriental languages and wrote learned commentaries on the Old Testament. He was the first to maintain that Isaias contains the work of two prophets. Moses Maimonides (died 1204), the greatest Jewish scholar of the Middle Ages, of whom his coreligionists said that "from Moses to Moses there was none like Moses", wrote his "Guide to the Perplexed", which was read by St. Thomas. He was a great admirer of Aristotle, who was to him the representative of natural knowledge as the Bible was of the supernatural. There were the two Kimchis, especially David (died 1235) of Narbonne, who was a celebrated grammarian, lexicographer, and commentator inclined to the literal sense. He was followed by Nachmanides of Catalonia (died 1270), a doctor of medicine who wrote commentaries of a cabbalistic tendency; Immanuel of Rome (born 1270); and the Karaites Aaron ben Joseph (1294), and Aaron ben Elias (fourteenth century). Modern. Isaac Abarbanel (born Lisbon, 1437; died Venice, 1508) was a statesman and scholar. None of his predecessors came so near the modern ideal of a commentator as he did. He prefixed general introductions to each book, and was the first Jew to make extensive use of Christian commentaries. Elias Levita (died 1549) and Azarias de Rossi (died 1577) have also to be mentioned. Moses Mendelssohn of Berlin (died 1786), a friend of Lessing, translated the Pentateuch into German. His commentaries (in Hebrew) are close, learned, critical, and acute. He had much influence, and was followed by Wessely, Jaros?aw, Homberg, Euchel, Friedlander, Hertz, Herxheimer, Ludwig Philippson, etc., called "Biurists", or expositors. The modern liberal school among the Jews is represented by Salomon Munk, Samuel David Luzzato, Leopold Zunz, Geiger, Julius F?rst, etc. In the past Jews attributed both the Written and the Unwritten Torahs to Moses; some modern Jews may deny that he had anything to do with either. Patristic commentaries. The history of Christian exegesis may be roughly divided into three periods: the Age of the Fathers, the Age of Caten? and Scholia (seventh to sixteenth century), and the Age of Modern Commentaries (sixteenth to twentieth century). Most of the patristic commentaries are in the form of homilies, or discourses to the faithful, and range over the whole of Scripture. There are two schools of interpretation, that of Alexandria and that of Antioch. Alexandrian School. The chief writers of the Alexandrian School were Its chief characteristic was the allegorical method. This was doubtless, founded on passages in the Gospels and the Epistles of St. Paul, but it received a strong impulse from the writings of Alexandrian Jews, especially of Philo. The great representative of this school was Origen (died 254). From his very earliest years Origen manifested such extraordinary marks of piety and genius that he was held in the very highest reverence by his father, himself a saint and martyr. Origen became the master of many great saints and scholars, one of the most celebrated being St. Gregory Thaumaturgus; he was known as the "Adamantine" on account of his incessant application to study, writing, lecturing, and works of piety. He frequently kept seven amanuenses actively employed; it was said he became the author of 6000 works (Epiphanius, H?r., lxiv, 63); according to St. Jerome, who reduced the number to 2000 (Contra. Rufin., ii, 22), he left more writings than any man could read in a lifetime (Ep. xxxiii, ad Paulam). Besides his great labours on the Hexapla he wrote scholia, homilies, and commentaries on the Old and the New Testament. In his scholia he gave short explanations of difficult passages after the manner of his contemporaries, the annotators of the Greek classics. Most of the scholia, in which he chiefly sought the literal sense, are unfortunately lost, but it is supposed that their substance is embodied in the writings of St. John Chrysostom and other Fathers. In his other works Origen pushed the allegorical interpretation to the utmost extreme. In spite of this, however, his writings were of great value, and with the exception of St. Augustine, no writer of ancient times had such influence. Antiochene School. The writers of the Antiochene School disliked the allegorical method, and sought almost exclusively the literal, primary, or historical sense of Holy Scripture. The principal writers of this school were The great representatives of this school were Diodorus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and St. John Chrysostom. Diodorus, who died Bishop of Tarsus (394), followed the literal to the exclusion of the mystical or allegorical sense. Theodore was born at Antioch, in 347, became Bishop of Mopsuestia, and died in the communion of the Church, 429. He was a powerful thinker, but an obscure and prolix writer. He felt intense dislike for the mystical sense, and explained the Scriptures in an extremely literal and almost rationalistic manner. His pupil, Nestorius, became a founder of heresy; the Nestorians translated his books into Syriac and regarded Theodore as their great "Doctor". This made Catholics suspicious of his writings, which were finally condemned after the famous controversy on The Three Chapters. Theodore's commentary on St. John's Gospel, in Syriac, was published, with a Latin translation, by a Catholic scholar, Dr. Chabot. St. John Chrysostom, priest of Antioch, became Patriarch of Constantinople in 398. As an interpreter of Holy Scripture he stands in the very first rank of the Fathers. He left homilies on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament. There is nothing in the whole of antiquity to equal his writings on St. Matthew's Gospel and St. Paul's Epistles. When St. Thomas Aquinas was asked by one of his brethren whether he would not like to be the owner of Paris, so that he could dispose of it to the King of France and with the proceeds promote the good works of his order, he answered that he would prefer to be the possessor of Chrysostom's "Super Matth?um". This reply may be taken as the true expression of the high admiration in which the writings of St. Chrysostom have ever been held in the Church. St. Isidore of Pelusium said of him that if the Apostle St. Paul could have used Attic speech he would have explained his own Epistles in the identical words of St. John Chrysostom. Intermediate School. Other writers combined both these systems, some leaning more to the allegorical and some to the literal sense. The principal contributors were Jerome, besides his translations of Scripture and other works, left many commentaries, in some of which he departed from the literal meaning of the text. At times he did not always indicate when he was quoting from different authors, which according to Richard Simon accounts for his apparent discrepancies. Medieval commentaries. The medieval writers were content to draw from the rich treasures left them by their predecessors. Their commentaries consisted, for the most part, of passages from the Church Fathers, which they connected together as in a chain, a "catena". Latin Catenists, Scholiasts, etc.. The principal Latin commentators of this period were the Venerable Bede, Walafrid Strabo, Anselm of Laon, Hugh of Saint-Cher, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Nicholas de Lyra. The Venerable Bede (seventh to eighth century), a good Greek and Hebrew scholar, wrote a useful commentary on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament. It is in reality a catena of passages from Greek and Latin Fathers judiciously selected and digested. Walafrid Strabo (ninth century), a Benedictine, was credited with the "Glossa Ordinaria" on the entire Bible. It is a brief explanation of the literal and mystical sense, based on Rabanus Maurus and other Latin writers, and was one of the most popular works during the Middle Ages, being as well known as "The Sentences" of Peter Lombard. Anselm of Laon, professor at Paris (twelfth century), wrote the "Glossa Interlinearis", so called because the explanation was inserted between the lines of the Vulgate. Hugh of Saint-Cher (Hugo de Sancto Caro), thirteenth century), besides his pioneer Biblical concordance, composed a short commentary on the whole of the Scriptures, explaining the literal, allegorical, analogical, and moral sense of the text. His work was called "Postill?", i. e. "post illa" ("verba textus"), because the explanation followed the words of the text. Thomas Aquinas (thirteenth century) left commentaries on Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Epistles of St. Paul, and was the author of the well-known "Catena Aurea" on the Gospels. This consists of quotations from over eighty Church Fathers. He throws much light on the literal sense and is most happy in illustrating difficult points by parallel passages from other parts of the Bible. Nicholas de Lyra (thirteenth century), joined the Franciscans in 1291 and brought to the service of the Church knowledge of Hebrew and rabbinical learning. He wrote short notes or "Postill?" on the entire Bible, and set forth the literal meaning with great ability, especially of the books written in Hebrew. This work was most popular, and in frequent use during the late Middle Ages, and Martin Luther was indebted to it. A great impulse was given to exegetical studies by the Council of Vienne which decreed, in 1311, that chairs of Hebrew, Chaldean, and Arabic should be established at Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca. Modern Catholic commentaries. The influx of Greek scholars into Italy after the fall of Constantinople, the Christian and anti-Christian Renaissance, the invention of printing, the controversial excitement caused by the rise of Protestantism, and the publication of polyglot Bibles by Cardinal Ximenes and others, gave renewed interest in the study of the Bible among Catholic scholars. Controversy showed them the necessity of devoting more attention to the literal meaning of the text, according to the wise principle laid down by St. Thomas in the beginning of his "Summa Theologica". It was then that the Jesuits, founded in 1534, stepped into the front rank to counter the attacks on the Catholic Church. The Ratio Studiorum of the Jesuits made it incumbent on their professors of Scripture to acquire a mastery of Greek, Hebrew, and other Oriental languages. Alfonso Salmeron, one of the first companions of Ignatius Loyola, and the pope's theologian at the Council of Trent, was a distinguished Hebrew scholar and voluminous commentator. Bellarmine, one of the first Christians to write a Hebrew grammar, composed a valuable commentary on the Psalms, giving an exposition of the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Vulgate texts. It was published as part of Cornelius a Lapide's commentary on the whole Bible. Cornelius a Lapide, S. J. (born 1566), was a native of the Low Countries, and was well versed in Greek and Hebrew. During forty years he devoted himself to teaching and to the composition of his great work, which has been highly praised by Protestants as well as Catholics. Juan Maldonato, a Spanish Jesuit, born 1584, wrote commentaries on Isaias, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, Psalms, Proverbs, Canticles (Song of Solomon), and Ecclesiastes. His best work, however, is his Latin commentary on the Four Gospels, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the best ever written. When Maldonato was teaching at the University of Paris the hall was filled with eager students before the lecture began, and he had frequently to speak in the open air. Great as was the merit of the work of Maldonato, it was equalled by the commentary on the Epistles by Estius (born at Gorcum, Holland, 1542), a secular priest, and superior of the College at Douai. These two works are still of the greatest help to the student. Nineteenth century. Catholics have also published scientific books. There is the great Latin "Cursus" on the whole of the Bible by the Jesuit Fathers, Karl Cornely, Joseph Knabenbauer, and Franz Hummelauer. The writings of Marie-Joseph Lagrange (Les Juges), Albert Condamin (Isa?e), Theodore Calmes (Saint Jean), Albin van Hoonacker (Les Douze Petits Proph?tes). For a list of Catholic publications on the Scripture, the reader may be referred to the "Revue biblique", edited by Lagrange (Jerusalem and Paris), and the "Biblische Zeitschrift', published by Herder (Freiburg im Breisgau). For further information concerning the principal Catholic commentators see respective articles. In general. The commentaries of the first Reformers, Luther, Melanchthon, Calvin, Zwingli and their followers wrote on Holy Scripture during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Isaiah 59-60 -- Mr. John Jackson Isaiah 61-66, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Gospels, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Revelation -- Dr. John Collinges Ezekiel, Minor Prophets -- Mr. Henry Hurst Ephesians, James, 1 and 2 Peter -- Mr. Edward Veale 1 and 2 Thessalonians -- Mr. Matthew Barker Philippians, Colossians -- Mr. Richard Adams 1, 2 and 3 John -- Mr. John Howe There were many commentaries published at Cambridge, Oxford, London, etc. (see publishers' catalogues, and notices in "Expositor", "Expository Times", and "Journal of Theological Studies"). Other writers are "The International Critical Commentary" is a work by many distinguished American and English scholars. There are also the Bible dictionaries of Kitto, Smith, and Hastings. Many of these works, especially the later ones, are valuable for their scientific method, though not of equal value for their views or conclusions. Rationalistic commentaries. The opinions of the English rationalists were disseminated on the Continent by Voltaire and others. In Germany the ground was prepared by the philosophy of Wolff and the writings of his disciple Semler. The posthumous writings of Reimarus were published by Lessing between 1774-78 ("The Fragments of Wolfenb?ttel"). Lessing pretended that the author was unknown. According to the "Fragments", Moses, Christ, and the Apostles were impostors. Lessing was vigorously attacked, especially by Goeze. Eichhorn, in his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (Leipzig 1780-83, 3 vols.), maintained that the Scriptures were genuine productions, but that, as the Jews saw the intervention of God in the most ordinary natural occurrences, the miracles should be explained naturally. Heinrich Paulus (1761?1850), following the lead of Eichhorn, applied to the Gospels the naturalistic method of explaining miracles. G. L Bauer, Heyne (died 1812), and Creuzer denied the authenticity of the greater portion of the Pentateuch and compared it to the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. The greatest advocate of such views was de Wette (1780?1849), a pupil of Paulus. In his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (1806) he maintained that the miraculous narratives of the Old Testament were popular legends, which in the course of centuries, became transformed and transfused with the marvellous and the supernatural, and were finally committed to writing in perfectly good faith. David Strauss (1808?74) applied this mythical explanation to the Gospels. He showed most clearly, that if with Paulus the Gospels are allowed to be authentic, the attempt to explain the miracles naturally breaks down completely. Strauss rejected the authenticity and regarded the miraculous accounts in the Gospels as naive legends, the productions of the pious imaginations of the early generations of Christians. The views of Strauss were severely criticized by the Catholics, Kuhn, Mack, Hug, and Sepp, and by the Protestants Neander, Tholuck, Ullman, Lange, Ewald, Riggenbach, Weiss, and Keim. Baur especially, the founder of the T?bingen School, proved that Strauss ran counter to the most clearly established facts of early Christian history, and showed the folly of denying the historical existence of Christ and His transcendent personality. Even Strauss lost all confidence in his own system. Baur originated a theory which was for a time in great vogue, but which was afterwards abandoned by the majority of critics. He held that the New Testament contains the writings of two antagonistic parties amongst the Apostles and early Christians. His principal followers were Zeller, Schwegler, Planck, K?slin, Ritsch, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, Tobler, Keim, Hosten, some of whom, however, emancipated themselves from their master. Holtzmann, while practically admitting the authenticity of the Gospels, especially of St. Mark, explains away the miracles. He believes that miracles do not happen, and that the scripture are merely echoes of Old Testament miracle stories. Holtzmann was severely taken to task by several writers in the "International Critical Commentary". The activity of so many acute minds has thrown great light on the language and literature of the Bible. External public domain Bible commentaries. Additionally, the Christian Classics Ethereal Library has presented a unified reference tool to access many commentaries from different traditions in their. Many recently published commentaries are now available to view through the Google Books Project. See these resources in Tyndale Seminary's and.
8502717	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_protection_of_access_to_abortion	Legal protection of access to abortion. Governments sometimes take measures designed to afford legal protection of access to abortion. Such legislation often seeks to guard facilities which provide induced abortion against obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect patients and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment. Another form such legislation sometimes takes is in the creation of a perimeter around a facility, known variously as a "buffer zone", "bubble zone", or "access zone". This area is intended to limit how close to these facilities demonstration by those who oppose abortion can approach. Protests and other displays are restricted to a certain distance from the building, which varies depending upon the law, or are prohibited altogether. Similar zones have also been created to protect the homes of abortion providers and clinic staff. Bubble zone laws are divided into "fixed" and "floating" categories. Fixed bubble zone laws apply to the static area around the facility itself, and floating laws to objects in transit, such as people or cars. Laws in Australia. Currently, there is no buffer zone legislation in Australia, but in 2005, the Australian Democrats proposed a law to create buffer zones around clinics in the state of Victoria. Laws in South Africa. The Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act prohibits anyone from "preventing the lawful termination of a pregnancy" or "obstructing access to a facility for the termination of a pregnancy", imposing a penalty of up to ten years' imprisonment. Laws in the United States. At the federal level in the United States, the "Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act" (FACE), makes it an offense to use intimidation or physical forcesuch as forming a blockadein order to prevent a person from entering a facility which provides reproductive healthcare or a place of worship. The law also creates specific penalties for destroying, or causing damage to, either of these types of building. In the February 2003 case, "Scheidler v. National Organization for Women," the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that pro-life activists could not be prosecuted under the "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act" (RICO), a law drafted to counter organized crime, or the Hobbs Act, a law intended to address economic damages caused by extortion. The Court reaffirmed this holding on February 28, 2006 in a unanimous decision, although only 8 Justices participated in the ruling, because Samuel Alito had not yet been confirmed. Debate. Supporters of such laws claim that these zones are necessary to ensure that women have access to abortion. They argue that a buffer zone helps to prevent blockading of a clinic's entrance, to protect the safety of patients and staff, and to ensure that clients do not feel intimidated, distressed, or harassed by the presence of pro-life activists. Some traditional free speech advocates such as the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association have cautiously sided in favour of limited "bubble zones" around abortion clinics on the basis that patients have a medical right to privacy when receiving confidential legal medical procedures that is compromised if protesters identify patients for the purpose of publicly shaming or intimidating them. Some pro-choice activists have also argued that anyone convicted of anti-abortion violence should be permanently banned from protesting outside abortion clinics. Professor Jacob M. Appel of New York University has argued that "[m]uch as we do not permit convicted pedophiles to teach kindergarten or convicted hijackers to board airplanes, common sense dictates that individuals who have been imprisoned for plotting violence against abortion clinics should never again be permitted anywhere near such facilities.". Those who oppose the creation of such legislation contend that "bubble zones", by limiting the ability to protest peacefully, represent an infringement upon their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.

8502728	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichester_Castle	Chichester Castle. Chichester Castle stood in the city of the same name in West Sussex (). Shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, ordered the construction of a castle at Chichester. The castle at Chichester was one of 11 fortified sites to be established in Sussex before 1100. The Rape of Chichester, a subdivision of Sussex, was administered from the castle and was split off from the larger Rape of Arundel; a Rape was an administrative unit originating in the Saxon era and continued by the Normans. Situated in the north-east corner of Chichester, the castle was protected by the city walls. As it was an urban castle inserted into a pre-existing settlement, buildings were probably cleared to make way for the castle. Chichester Castle was of timber construction; although some timber castles were rebuilt in stone, there is no evidence that this was the case at Chichester Castle. Although originally built by the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Earls of Sussex owned the castle in the period 1154?1176, after which it passed into possession of the Crown. Early in the 13th century, Chichester Castle was used as a court and jail. Chichester and Oxford Castle were some of the earliest urban castles to be used for this purpose, but gradually most urban castles were also used in this way. In 1216, the castle, along with many others in southern England, such as Reigate Castle, was captured by the French. This was part of the First Barons' War against King John of England (1199?1216). The castle was recaptured by the English in the spring of 1217. In the same year, Henry III ordered the castle's destruction. Between 1222 and 1269, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, gave the site to the order of Greyfriars for them use as the site of a friary. The remains of the motte are still visible today in Priory Park; the motte is protected as a Scheduled Monument.
